# DATS6103_Project
This project delves into the rich dataset provided by the NASA Exoplanet Archive, which contains comprehensive information on exoplanets discovered through various methods and across different years. The aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can enhance our understanding of exoplanetary systems. 
By rigorously analyzing this dataset, we aspire to shed light on the progress and limitations of observational techniques, ultimately contributing to the advancement of exoplanet research and planetary formation theories.
